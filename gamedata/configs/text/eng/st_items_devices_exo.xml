		<text>Auxiliary power supply equipped on exoskeletons to increase their energy capacity. Popular with most stalkers given the rather inefficient powerplants that come with standard exoskeletons. To use, drag onto an exoskeleton.\n \nThis type of power supply is haphazardly put together and quite inefficient. While lightweight, it only offers a marginal bonus to energy capacity. One of the major drawbacks to most exoskeletons is that they are intended to be fielded for a short amount of time, usually in pitched battles before returning to base to reacharge. External power supplies like these can partially alleviate the problem, but, as clearly shown by this, do not necessarily work so well.\n\n

The contained artifact feedback loop continuously generates small amounts of power, and passively charges the power supply of existing exoskeletons - while it is a near limitless power source, the copious amounts of containment and shielding built into the backpack make it unbearably heavy. \n \n

Designed to be complement frontline troops who need to push forward in heavy fire, this prototype uses the gravitational properties of the Empty artifact to generate a localized anomaly zone on activation. The anomaly zone is centered on the user and effectively slows down high-velocity projectiles and shrapnel, as well as rendering mutant attacks useless. However, the gravity well interferes with user movement. \n \n

		<text>Scientific paper penned by V.R. Solenov and R.R. Romanovich, detailing the behavior and observed effects of Battery artifacts when subject to various strengths of electromagnetic fields. Under certain VPM levels the Battery is observed to emit brief, intense surges of direct current from the artifact, with the effect not having any correlation with the strength of the field. It is very wordy and verbose, and accompanying the text and equations are several graphs, black and white photos, and test logs. At the back of the paper are schematics on how to contain such a Battery artifact to cause it to output more voltage when subject to a positive current. The notebook is stamped with the official seal of the Ukrainian Ministry of Science.\n\n

	<string id="st_exo_recipe_2_descr">
		<text>Scientific paper penned by A.N. Perchenov and V.R. Solenov, detailing the observations of the Full Empty artifact's peculiar gravitational effects. According to the document, the space between Empty disks is the consequence of two disks partially distorting spacetime relative to the positions of each other to create a miniature gravitational anomaly. The contents of what the 'full' part of the Full Empty are remain unknown and are speculated to be the visible form of air particles charged with highly excited zero-point energy. When subject to an alternating current of a certain amperage under vacuum conditions, the contents temporarily dissipate and the gravitational anomaly contained between the two disks expands to create a nearly impervious 'shell' where any solid objects entering the space are caught and deflected from their original trajectory. The discovery of this behavior supposedly injured four interns and two lab assistants when the correct configuration was dialed in. Within the experiment log is a diagram of the vacuum containment device required to replicate this behavior.\n\n

		<text>Application of 'Flash' artifact fields to engine power output</text>

	<string id="st_exo_recipe_3_descr">
		<text>Scientific paper penned by R.R. Romanovich and A.N. Perchenov, detailing the strange effects that Flash artifacts have on electrically-powered machinery. When a Flash artifact is subjected to a positive electric current in vacuum, the artifact projects a variously sized anomalous field that vastly increases the physical output of electrical machinery in the area - motors run faster, CPUs overclock, and even mechanical watches move faster. Various experimental logs note the propensity of the machines to burn themselves out due to high heat and friction generated if the field is sustained for a prolonged period of time, and most of the paper is otherwise speculation at what could cause such a behavior. The latest prevailing theory is a quantum level influence increasing the flow of electricity and strength of magnetism. However, such theories are unconfirmed. In the middle of the paper is a diagram detailing the containment chamber construction of the artifact used in experimentation.\n\n

			%c[pda_white]Powered Exoskeletons \n \n %c[ui_gray_1] 
			Exoskeletons now each have their own unique power source. The power level must be maintained in order for an exoskeleton to move around effectively.
			\n \n%c[pda_blue]Exo batteries%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n Exoskeleton power reserves can be recharged with batteries purchased from traders or found in the world. Batteries hold a default of 100 power, which is enough to fully top off an un-upgraded exoskeleton.
			\n Exoskeleton power drains with movement, faster with sprinting. If the power drops to 0, the player will be slowed to a ridiculous extent unless the armor is removed.
			\n \n%c[pda_green]External power supplies%c[ui_gray_1]
			\n Exoskeletons can be upgraded with power supplies that are purchasable, craftable, and lootable. 
			\n To equip a power supply, drag and drop the power supply onto the armor or right-click the power supply while the exoskeleton is equipped.
			\n Power supplies increase the energy capacity of an exoskeleton beyond 100, and higher level versions confer unique benefits and powers.
